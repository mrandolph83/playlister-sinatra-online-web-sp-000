# Each class you build will need to have a method to slugify 
# each object's name. This means you'll need to strip out any 
# special characters, and replace all spaces with -.

# You'll need to build a method slug which takes a given 
# song/artist/genre name and create the "slugified" version.

# The find_by_slug method should use the slug method to 
# retrieve a song/artist/genre from the database and return 
# that entry.
